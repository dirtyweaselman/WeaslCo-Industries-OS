# WeaslCo Industries OS

Hello reader.
You may be wondering what this is.
It is an old operating system I found laying around on an old CD.
It was an .iso format, but after decoding a bit, I discovered it was converted from a Python script to a .iso.
I'm unsure how they did that, but if you wanna discover a bit, I packaged it into a .exe for ease of use.
It runs in a command prompt window because it's how it ran originally.
I also have no clue where the CD came from, but here we are.
I will be editing this code as time goes on, because I think it's interesting.

## Features:
* A mail system, presumably a test, due to it not having any online functionality.
* Word processor that saves to .txt
* Web browser, though no websites seem to work. They all seem to be "restricted".
* Hacking practice, seems to be a fake hacking practice game.
