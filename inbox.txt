Subject: Thank you!
We would like to thank you for your recent purchase of our operating system. Please read the instruction manual to get familiar with your new system. We tried to streamline the interface and make the OS more compatible with other computer systems, not just ours. We see you are using our OS on a Model 2300 series machine from us. This model is a bit old, so if you stop by one of our shops, we offer you a 50% off discount of a Model 5400 series system. It has 32MB of RAM, compared to your 8MB, a disc drive, and a new networking chip. Thanks again!
